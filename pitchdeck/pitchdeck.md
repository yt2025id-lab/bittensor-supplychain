# AI Supply Chain Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title & Tagline
- **Project Name:** AI Supply Chain Subnet
- **Tagline:** Supply Chain, Decentralized
- **Subtitle:** Real-time predictive logistics intelligence on Bittensor
- **Logo/Image:** [Insert project logo or supply chain/logistics icon]

## Slide 2: Problem
- Supply chain disruptions cost the global economy **$184B+ annually**.
- Data is siloed across manufacturers, shippers, and retailers with no shared visibility.
- Predictions are centralized, opaque, and often inaccurate.
- Small businesses lack access to enterprise-grade supply chain intelligence.
- **Image:** Broken supply chain, container ships stuck, empty shelves.

## Slide 3: Solution
- Decentralized supply chain oracle network on Bittensor.
- Logistics experts and AI models collaborate for real-time tracking and prediction.
- IoT data aggregation from multiple sources for comprehensive visibility.
- On-chain transparency; $TAO rewards incentivize accurate and timely data.

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity
- Supply chain analytics market: **$22.3B by 2028** (Fortune Business Insights).
- Supply chain management software: **$30.9B by 2026** (Gartner).
- IoT in logistics: **$40B+ market** and growing.
- Target segments: manufacturers, e-commerce, 3PL providers, retailers, SMBs.

## Slide 5: How It Works (Mechanism Design)
- **Step 1:** User submits a supply chain query (product, origin, destination, shipment ID).
- **Step 2:** Miners aggregate IoT/ERP data and run prediction models.
- **Step 3:** Validators verify predictions against actual shipment data and third-party sources.
- **Step 4:** Quality scores computed; $TAO rewards distributed proportionally.
- **Step 5:** All predictions and outcomes recorded on-chain for accountability.
- **Diagram:** Flow: Query -> Miners -> Prediction -> Validators -> Score -> Reward.

## Slide 6: Miner & Validator Design
- **Miner Tasks:**
  - Aggregate data from IoT sensors, ERP systems, shipping APIs
  - Predict delivery time, disruption risk, optimal routes
  - Real-time tracking status updates
  - Performance metric: Prediction Accuracy, Data Freshness
- **Validator Tasks:**
  - Compare predictions vs actual delivery outcomes
  - Cross-reference with shipping carrier APIs and customs data
  - Scoring formula: `Score = 0.5 * PredictionAccuracy + 0.3 * DataFreshness + 0.2 * Coverage`
- **Image:** Miner/Validator role diagram with IoT data flow.

## Slide 7: Bittensor Integration & Incentives
- Runs as a dedicated Bittensor subnet.
- Miner Reward: `alpha * InsightQuality * QueryReward`
- Validator Reward: `beta * ValidationScore * TotalReward`
- Staking mechanism for validator trust.
- Historical accuracy tracked on-chain per miner for reputation.

## Slide 8: Competitive Advantage
- **vs FourKites/Project44:** Decentralized data sourcing, no vendor lock-in, open access.
- **vs SAP/Oracle SCM:** 10x cheaper, community-driven, real-time IoT native.
- **vs Chainlink (Oracle):** Domain-specific for supply chain, not just price feeds.
- **Moat:** More data sources = better predictions = more users (network effects).
- **Image:** Competitive matrix table.

## Slide 9: Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Launch subnet on testnet; recruit logistics data providers.
- **Phase 2:** Partner with e-commerce platforms and 3PL providers for real data.
- **Phase 3:** Enterprise API for ERP integration (SAP, Oracle, Shopify).
- **Phase 4:** Open marketplace for custom prediction models and route optimization.
- **Channels:** Logistics conferences, e-commerce partnerships, Web3 community.

**Tips:**
- Use blue/orange industrial color scheme for logistics feel.
- Include real supply chain disruption examples (Suez Canal, COVID) as context.
- Emphasize verifiable predictions as key differentiator from centralized solutions.
