## Problem, Solution, Vision & Mission
### Problem
- Supply chain disruptions are costly and hard to predict.
- Data is siloed across organizations.
- Lack of real-time, collaborative analytics.

### Solution
- Bittensor-powered subnet for decentralized supply chain analytics.
- Contributors (logistics experts, AI models) are rewarded for insights.
- All tracking and analytics are on-chain for transparency.

### Vision
To optimize global supply chains through decentralized intelligence.

### Mission
- Deliver real-time, predictive analytics for logistics.
- Reward contributors for impactful insights.
- Ensure transparency and trust in supply chain operations.

## How It Works
### Architecture
- **Bittensor Subnet:** Runs as a subnet, leveraging mining, staking, and rewards.
- **Supply Chain Query & Response:** Users submit tracking queries; contributors provide status, predictions, and recommendations.
- **Validator & Miner:** Validators assess insight quality, miners provide analytics. Rewards distributed in $TAO.
- **Smart Contract:** All rewards and reputations managed on-chain.

### Main Mechanism
1. User submits a supply chain query (product, location).
2. Miners (experts/AI) provide status, predictions, and recommendations.
3. Validators assess quality and relevance.
4. $TAO rewards distributed to contributors and validators.
5. All activities recorded on Bittensor blockchain.

### Key Terms
- **Miner:** Node providing supply chain analytics.
- **Validator:** Node assessing analytics quality.
- **Subnet:** Specialized Bittensor network for supply chain.
- **TAO:** Bittensor's native token for incentives.

### Reward Formula (Simplified)
Miner Reward = α × (Insight Quality Score) × (Query Reward)

Validator Reward = β × (Validation Score) × (Total Reward)

α, β = incentive coefficients set by the subnet owner.

## Quick Guide
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the API: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Submit tracking queries via `/track` endpoint
4. Integrate with Bittensor nodes for mining/validation (see Bittensor docs)

## [Optional] Roadmap
- Real-time IoT integration
- Open-source logistics models
- Collaboration with other supply chain subnets
